            <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Certificates are data structures that include a public key, a digital signature, and some other data. Clients use certificates to authenticate servers during TLS handshakes.</p>

            <h4 id="what">What certificates are</h4>

            <p>TLS certificates are used to authenticate endpoints. They allow you to be reasonably confident that you're connecting to the website you think you're connecting to. Your browser received a certificate shortly before it received this sentence. You should be able to find the certificate for a website if you click one of the icons on the left side of the address bar and drill down into the menu.</p>

            <p>This is the human-readable representation of a certificate, which is actually a binary data structure encoded in ASN.1. If you were to cat out a raw certificate in a terminal, you'd mostly see a bunch of garbage:</p>
